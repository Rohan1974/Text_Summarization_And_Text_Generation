**Project Title:** **Text Summarization and Next Word Prediction with LSTMs and Transformers**


**Abstract:**
This project explores two key Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: text summarization and next word prediction. It delves into both custom-built and pre-trained transformer models for summarization, evaluating their efficacy. Additionally, it implements an LSTM-based next word prediction approach.

**Part 1: Text Summarization**
* **From Scratch:** Develops a text summarization model from fundamental principles, providing valuable insights into the core mechanisms.
* **Pre-trained Transformers:** Leverages the power of pre-trained transformers like **BERT**, **GPT-2**, **XLNet**, **Pegasus**, and **T5** to explore their performance on the summarization task.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Rigorously compares summarization models using appropriate metrics to identify the most accurate approach. The project identifies Pegasus as the top performer in this evaluation.


**Part 2: Next Word Prediction with LSTMs**
* **Preprocessing:** Implements essential text preprocessing steps like tokenization and potentially **part-of-speech (POS) tagging** (depending on the dataset and chosen model architecture) to prepare the text data for the **LSTM model**.
* **LSTM Model Development:** Constructs an LSTM-based next word prediction model, leveraging its ability to capture sequential relationships within text data.
* **Training and Evaluation:** Trains the LSTM model on a suitable dataset, rigorously evaluating its performance using established accuracy metrics (e.g., perplexity or character-level accuracy) across multiple epochs.


**Key Contributions:**
* Comparative analysis of custom-built and pre-trained transformers for text summarization.
* Comprehensive implementation of LSTM-based next word prediction with effective preprocessing.
* Clear evaluation measures to assess the effectiveness of both models.


**Future Work:**
* Explore fine-tuning pre-trained transformers for domain-specific summarization tasks.
* Experiment with advanced LSTM architectures (e.g., bi-directional LSTMs, attention mechanisms) for potentially improved next word prediction.
* Investigate the integration of the summarization and prediction models for potential downstream NLP applications.

**This project provides a valuable foundation for understanding and applying NLP techniques for text summarization and next word prediction.**
